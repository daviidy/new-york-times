This project is the third in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse
It consists of building an article from the New York Times.


The page is very straightforward, so you should be able to clone it even if your CSS skills aren‚Äôt perfect.

In this project, our assignment was to copy this article from the New York Times

We worked on all the requirements given on this project.

- We used semantic HTML elements for the header, the main content and the footer.
- We styled the elements to look like the real webpage.
- We used some CSS positioning techniques like Flexbox and Grid. Wa have ignored any ads, comments or interactive elements (which use JavaScript) and media queries.


## Built With

- HTML
- CSS: Flex and grid
